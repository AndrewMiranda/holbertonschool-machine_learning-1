In the following directory we will find a copilation of files wich porpuse is to understand the concepts of using LInear Algebra and help us to answer the next questions.
-   What is a determinant? How would you calculate it?
-   What is a minor, cofactor, adjugate? How would calculate them?
-   What is an inverse? How would you calculate it?
-   What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors? How would you calculate them?
-   What is definiteness of a matrix? How would you determine a matrixâ€™s definiteness?
