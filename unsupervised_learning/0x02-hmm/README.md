# 0x02. Hidden Markov Models

In the following directory we will find a copilation of files wich porpuse is to understand the concepts of usingHidden Markov Models and help us to answer the next questions.
-   What is the Markov property?
-   What is a Markov chain?
-   What is a state?
-   What is a transition probability/matrix?

-   How to determine if a transition matrix is regular
-   What is an absorbing state?
-   What is a transient state?
-   What is a recurrent state?
-   What is an absorbing Markov chain?
-   What is a Hidden Markov Model?
-   What is a hidden state?
-   What is an observation?
-   What is an emission probability/matrix?
-   What is a Trellis diagram?
-   What is the Forward algorithm and how do you implement it?
