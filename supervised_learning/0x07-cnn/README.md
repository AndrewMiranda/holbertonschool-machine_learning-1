# 0x07. Convolutional Neural Networks

In the following directory we will find a copilation of files wich porpuse is to understand the concept of convulutions in neural networks and help us to answer the next questions.
 -   What is a convolutional layer?
-   What is a pooling layer?
-   Forward propagation over convolutional and pooling layers
-   Back propagation over convolutional and pooling layers
-   How to build a CNN using Tensorflow and Keras
