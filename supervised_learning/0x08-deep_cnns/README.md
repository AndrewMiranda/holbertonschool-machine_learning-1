# 0x08. Deep Convolutional Architectures
In this directory we will find a compilation of files to work as a tutorial of deep convolutional architectures and answer the next questions:
-   What is a skip connection?
-   What is a bottleneck layer?
-   What is the Inception Network?
-   What is ResNet? ResNeXt? DenseNet?
-   How to replicate a network architecture by reading a journal article
