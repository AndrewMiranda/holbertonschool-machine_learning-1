# 0x01. Classification

In the following directory we will find a copilation of files that recreate a neural network capable to distnguish number draing by hand, also we want to answer the next questions:
-   What is a model?
-   What is supervised learning?
-   What is a prediction?
-   What is a node?
-   What is a weight?
-   What is a bias?
-   What are activation functions?
    -   Sigmoid?
    -   Tanh?
    -   Relu?
    -   Softmax?
-   What is a layer?
-   What is a hidden layer?
-   What is Logistic Regression?
-   What is a loss function?
-   What is a cost function?
-   What is forward propagation?
-   What is Gradient Descent?
-   What is back propagation?
-   What is a Computation Graph?
-   How to initialize weights/biases
-   The importance of vectorization
-   How to split up your data
-   What is multiclass classification?
-   What is a one-hot vector?
-   How to encode/decode one-hot vectors
-   What is the softmax function and when do you use it?
-   What is cross-entropy loss?
